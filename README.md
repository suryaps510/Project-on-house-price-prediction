# Project-on-house-price-prediction
In this machine learning project we used 2 datasets as train file and test file and used it to train our model using random forest regressor and put it into a pipeline to predict the saleprices of the house 
The datasets were taken from kaggle as 3 datasets i.e 1)Training dataset 2)Testing dataset 3)Sample submission
We used these datasets to plot different types of graphs including a heatmap to predict the sales prices of the houses based on their features.
We used a pre-processor pipeline and pass the x_train and y_train datasets to train the model and predict the sales prices as final submission.
